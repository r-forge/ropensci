## check that a factor becomes nominal/enumeratedDomain with levels defined

## check that an ordered becomes an ordinal/enumeratedDomain

## check that a numeric becomes a ratio

## check that a Date becomes a dateTime

## check that a character can become a nominal/textDefinition

## Write more simple data cases showing this diversity of data types..
