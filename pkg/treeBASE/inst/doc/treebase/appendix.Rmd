Reproducible computation: A diversification rate analysis
---------------------------------------------------------

This appendix illustrates the diversification rate analysis discussed in
the main text.  For completeness we begin by executing the code discussed
in the manuscript which locates, downloads, and imports the relevant data:

``` {r libs, include=FALSE, dependson="loadcache"}
library(treebase)
results <- search_treebase("10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01374.x", "doi") 
bt <- branching.times(results[[1]])
````


Different diversification models make different assumptions about the rate
of speciation, extinction, and how these rates may be changing over time.
The original authors consider eight different models, implemented in the
laser package [@Rabosky2006b]. This code fits each of the eight models
to that data:

``` {r   RR, tidy=FALSE, dependson="loadcache"  }
library(ape)
library(laser)
models <- list(
  yule = pureBirth(bt),  
  birth_death = bd(bt),     
  yule.2.rate = yule2rate(bt),
  linear.diversity.dependent = DDL(bt),    
  exponential.diversity.dependent = DDX(bt),
  varying.speciation_rate = fitSPVAR(bt),  
  varying.extinction_rate = fitEXVAR(bt),  
  varying_both = fitBOTHVAR(bt))
````

Each of the model estimate includes an Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) score indicating the goodness of fit, penalized by model complexity
(lower scores indicate better fits) We ask R to tell us which model has
the lowest AIC score,

``` {r   extract_aic, dependson="loadcache" }
aics <- sapply(models, function(model) model$aic)
best_fit <- names(models[which.min(aics)])
```` 

and confirm the result presented in @Derryberry2011; that the best-fit
model in the laser analysis was a Yule (net diversification rate) model
with two separate rates.  

We can ask ` TreePar ` to see if a model with more rate shifts is favoured
over this single shift, a question that was not possible to address using
the tools provided in `laser`. The previous analysis also considers a
birth-death model that allowed speciation and extinction rates to be
estimated separately, but did not allow for a shift in the rate of such
a model.  In the main text we introduced a model from @Stadler2011 that
permitted up to 3 change-points in the speciation rate of the Yule model,

``` {r   treepar-yule, include=FALSE}
yule_models <- bd.shifts.optim(x, sampling = c(1,1,1,1), 
  grid = 5, start = 0, end = 60, yule = TRUE)[[2]]
````


``` {r   treepar-yule_show, eval=FALSE  }
yule_models <- bd.shifts.optim(x, sampling = c(1,1,1,1), 
  grid = 5, start = 0, end = 60, yule = TRUE)[[2]]
````

We can also compare the performance of models which allow up to three
shifts while estimating extinction and speciation rates separately:

``` {r   treepar-birthdeath, include=FALSE  }
birth_death_models <- bd.shifts.optim(x, sampling = c(1,1,1,1), 
  grid = 5, start = 0, end = 60, yule = FALSE)[[2]]
````

``` {r   treepar-birthdeath_show, eval=FALSE  }
birth_death_models <- bd.shifts.optim(x, sampling = c(1,1,1,1), 
  grid = 5, start = 0, end = 60, yule = FALSE)[[2]]
````

The models output by these functions are ordered by increasing number
of shifts.  We can select the best-fitting model by AIC score, which is
slightly cumbersome in `TreePar` syntax.  First, we compute the AIC scores
of both the `yule_models` and the `birth_death_models` we fitted above,

``` {r   aic-yule1  }
yule_aic <- 
sapply(yule_models, function(pars)
                    2 * (length(pars) - 1) + 2 * pars[1] )
birth_death_aic <- 
sapply(birth_death_models, function(pars)
                            2 * (length(pars) - 1) + 2 * pars[1] )
````

Then we generate a list identifying which model has the best (lowest)
AIC score among the Yule models and which has the best AIC score among
the birth-death models,

```{r aic-yule2}
best_no_of_rates <- list(Yule = which.min(yule_aic), 
                         birth.death = which.min(birth_death_aic))
````

The best model is then whichever of these has the smaller AIC value.  

```{r aic-yule3}
best_model <- which.min(c(min(yule_aic), min(birth_death_aic)))
````


which still confirms that the `r names(best_no_of_rates[best_model])` `r best_no_of_rates[best_model][[1]]`-rate  model is still the best choice based on AIC score.  Of the eight models 
in this second analysis, only three were in the original set considered 
(Yule 1-rate and 2-rate, and birth-death without a shift), so we could by
no means have been sure ahead of time that a birth death with a shift, or
a Yule model with a greater number of shifts, would not have fitted better.
