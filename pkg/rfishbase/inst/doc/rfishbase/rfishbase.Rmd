% rfishbase: exploring, manipulating and visualizing FishBase data from R

# Abstract 
This paper introduces a package that provides interactive and programmatic
access to the FishBase repository. This package allows one to
interact with data on over 30,000 fish species in the rich
statistical computing environment, `R`. This
direct, scriptable interface to FishBase data enables better
discovery and integration essential for large-scale comparative
analyses. The paper provides several examples to illustrate how the package
works, and how it can be integrated into phylogenetics
packages such as `ape` and `geiger`.

FishBase ([fishbase.org](http://fishbase.org)) is an award-winning online
database of information about the morphology, trophic ecology, physiology,
ecotoxicology, reproduction and economic relevance of the world's fishes,
organized by species [@fishbase2012].  This repository of information
has proven to be a profoundly valuable community resource and the data has
the potential to be used in a wide range of studies. However, assembling
subsets of data housed in FishBase for use in focused analyses can be
tedious and time-consuming. To facilitate the extraction, visualization,
and integration of this data, the `rfishbase` package was been written
for the R language for statistical computing and graphics [@rteam2012].
R is a freely available open source computing environment that is used
extensively in ecological research, with a large collection of packages
built explicitly for this purpose [@kneib2007].


The `rfishbase` package is dynamically updated
from the FishBase database, describe its functions for extracting,
manipulating and visualizing data, and then illustrate how these functions
can be combined for more complicated analyses.  Lastly it illustrates
how having access to FishBase data through R allows a user to interface
with other resources such as comparative phylogenetics software. The purpose
of this paper is to introduce `rfishbase` and illustrate core features of its functionality.


# Accessing FishBase data from R

In addition to its web-based interface, FishBase provides machine readable
XML files for `r length(fish.data)` (as accessed on 14 May, 2012) of
its species entries to facilitate programmatic access of the data housed in this resource.
As complete downloads of the FishBase database are not available, the
FishBase team encouraged us to use these XML files as an entry point
for programmatic access. We have introduced caching and pausing features
into the package to prevent access from over-taxing the FishBase servers.  
While FishBase encourages the use of its data by programmatic access,
(Froese, pers. comm), users of `rfishbase` should respect these load-limiting
functions, and provide appropriate acknowledgment. A more detailed 
discussion of incentives, ethics, and legal requirements in sharing and 
accessing such repositories can be found in the respective literature, _e.g._ 
@fisher2010 or @markcostello2009.  


The `rfishbase` package works by creating a cached copy of all data on
FishBase currently available in XML format on the FishBase webpages.
This process relies on the RCurl [@rcurl] and XML [@xml] packages to access these
pages and parse the resulting XML into a local cache.  Caching increases the speed
of queries and greatly reduces demands on the FishBase server, which in
its present form is not built to support direct access to application
programming interfaces (APIs). A cached copy is included in the package 
and can be loaded in to R using the command:

``` {r loaddata }
data(fishbase) 
````

This loads a copy of all available data from FishBase into the R list, 
`fish.data`, which can be passed to the various functions of `rfishbase`
for extraction, manipulation and visualization.  The online repository
is frequently updated as new information is uploaded.  To get the most 
recent copy of FishBase, update the cache instead. The
update may take up to 24 hours. This copy is stored in the specified 
directory (note that "." can be used to indicate the current working directory)
with the current date.  The most recent copy of the data
in the specified path can be loaded with the `loadCache()` function.  
If no cached set is found, `rfishbase` will load the copy originally
included in the package.  

``` {r update, eval=FALSE }
updateCache(".")
loadCache(".")
````
Loading the database creates an object called fish.data, with one entry
per fish species for which data was successfully found, for a total of
`r length(fish.data)` species.  

Not all the data available in FishBase is included in these machine-readable 
XML files.  Consequently, `rfishbase` returns taxonomic information, trophic
description, habitat, distribution, size, life-cycle, morphology and diagnostic
information.  The information returned in each category is provided as plain-text,
consequently `rfishbase` must use regular expression matching to identify
the occurrence of particular words or patterns in this text corresponding to 
data of interest [@friedl2006].  Any regular expression can be used in
in search queries.  While these expressions allows for very precise pattern matching,
applying this approach to plain text runs some risk of error which should
not be ignored.  Visual inspection of matches and careful construction of these expressions
can help mitigate this risk. We provide example functions for reliably matching 
several quantitative traits from these text-based descriptions, which can 
be used as a basis for writing functions to identify other terms of interest.  


Quantitative traits such as standard length, maximum known age, spine and ray counts,
and depth information are provided consistently for most species, allowing 
`rfishbase` to extract this data directly.  Other queries require pattern matching.
While simple text searches within a given field are usually reliable, the 
`rfishbase` search functions will take any regular expression query, which
permits logical matching, identification of number strings, and much more.
The interested user should consult a reference on regular expressions after
studying the simple examples provided here to learn more.  

# Tools for data extraction, analysis, and visualization

The basic tool for data extraction in `rfishbase` is the `which_fish()`
function. This function takes a list of FishBase data (usually the entire
database, `fish.data`, or a subset thereof, as illustrated later) and returns
an array of those species matching the query.  This array is given as a list of
true/false values for every species in the query.  This return structure has
several advantages which are illustrated below.  

Here is a query for reef-associated fish (mention of "reef" in the habitat 
description), and second query for fish that have "nocturnal" in their trophic 
description:

``` {r nocturnal }
reef <- which_fish("reef", "habitat", fish.data)
nocturnal <- which_fish("nocturnal", "trophic", fish.data)
````
One way these returned values are commonly used is to obtain a subset of the 
database that meets this criteria, which can then be passed on to other 
functions. For instance, if one wants the scientific names of these reef fish, 
one can use the `fish_names` function.  Like the `which_fish` function, it 
takes the list of FishBase data, `fish.data` as input.  In this example, just the 
subset that are reef affiliated are passed to the function,

``` {r }
reef_species <- fish_names(fish.data[reef])
````

Because our `reef` object is a list of logical values (true/false), one can
combine this in intuitive ways with other queries.  For instance, one can 
query for the names of all fish that are both nocturnal and not reef associated,

``` {r }
nocturnal_nonreef_orders <- fish_names(fish.data[nocturnal & !reef], "Class")
````

Note that in this example, it is also specified that the user wants the
taxonomic Class of the fish matching the query, rather than the species
names. `fish_names` will allow the user to specify any taxonomic level
for it to return.  Quantitative trait queries work in a similar manner
to `fish_names`, taking the FishBase data and returning the requested
information.  For instance, the function `getSize` returns the length
(default), weight, or age of the fish in the query:

``` {r AgeHist }
age <- getSize(fish.data, "age")
````

`rfishbase` can also extract a table of quantitative traits from the morphology 
field, describing the number of vertebrate, dorsal and anal fin spines and rays,

``` {r quantify-morphology}
morphology_numbers <- getQuantTraits(fish.data)
````

and extract the depth range (extremes and usual range) from the habitat field,

``` {r depths}
depths <- getDepth(fish.data)
````


A list of all the functions provided by `rfishbase` can be found in Table 1.  
The `rfishbase` manual provided with the package provides more detail about
each of these functions, together with examples for their use.  

``` {r Table1, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
options(xtable.include.rownames=FALSE)
knitcitations::functiontable("rfishbase", caption='A list of each of the functions and data objects provided by rfishbase')
````

The real power of programmatic access is the ease with which one can combine,
visualize, and statistically test a custom compilation of this data. 
To do so it is useful to organize a collection of queries into a data frame.
The next set of commands combines the queries made above and a few additional
queries into a data frame in which each row represents a species and each 
column represents a variable.  


``` {r fishdataframe }
marine <- which_fish("marine", "habitat", fish.data)
africa <- which_fish("Africa:", "distribution", fish.data)
length <- getSize(fish.data, "length")
order <- fish_names(fish.data, "Order")
dat <- data.frame(reef, nocturnal,  age, marine, africa, length, order)
````

This data frame contains categorical data (*e.g.* is the fish a
carnivore) and continuous data (*e.g.* weight or age of fish). One can
take advantage of data visualization tools in R to begin exploring
this data.  These examples are simply meant to be illustrative of the 
kinds of analysis possible and how they would be constructed.  

For instance, one can identify which orders contain the greatest number of
species, and for each of them, plot the fraction in which the species are 
marine.


``` {r relabel, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE }
# Relabel marine=true/false to Marine, Non-marine
i <- dat[["reef"]] 
dat$reef[i] <- "Reef"
dat$reef[!i] <- "Non-reef"
````


``` {r biggest}
biggest <- names(head(sort(table(order),decr=T), 8))
primary_orders <- subset(dat, order %in% biggest)
````


``` {r Figure1, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap='Fraction of marine species in the eight largest orders of teleost fishes', dependson="libraries"}
ggplot(primary_orders, aes(order, fill=marine)) + geom_bar() + 
# a few commands to customize appearance 
  geom_bar(colour="black",show_guide=FALSE) +  
  opts(axis.text.x=theme_text(angle=90, hjust=1, size=6)) + 
  opts(legend.title=theme_blank(), legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(.9,.6)) +
  scale_fill_grey(labels=c("Marine", "Non-marine")) + 
  xlab("") + ylab("Number of species")
````

FishBase data excels for comparative studies across many species, but searching 
through over 30,000 species to extract data makes broad comparative analyses 
quite time-consuming.  Having access to the data in R, one can answer such questions as 
fast as they are posed. Consider looking for a correlation between the maximum 
age and the size of fish.  One can partition the data by any variable 
of interest as well -- this example color codes the points based on whether or 
not the species is marine-associated.  The `ggplot2` package [@ggplot2] 
provides a particularly powerful and flexible language for visual exploration 
of such patterns.

``` {r Figure2, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap='Scatterplot maximum age with length observed in each species. Color indicates marine or freshwater species.', dependson="libraries"}
ggplot(dat,aes(age, length, shape=marine)) +
  geom_point(position='jitter', size=1) +
  scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10(breaks=c(50,100,200)) +
  scale_shape_manual(values=c(1,19), labels=c("Marine", "Non-marine")) + 
  ylab("Standard length (cm)") + xlab("Maximum observed age (years)") +
  opts(legend.title=theme_blank(), legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(.9,0)) +
  opts(legend.key = theme_blank())
````

A wide array of visual displays are available for different kinds of data. 
A box-plot is a natural way to compare the distributions of categorical 
variables, such as asking "Are reef species longer lived than non-reef species
in the marine environment?"

``` {r Figure3, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap='Distribution of maximum age for reef-associated and non-reef associated fish', dependson="libraries"}
ggplot(subset(dat, marine)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(reef, age)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + xlab("") +
  ylab("Maximum observed age (years)")  +
  opts(axis.text.x = theme_text(size = 8))
````


In addition to powerful visualizations R provides an unparalleled array of statistical analysis methods.  
Executing the linear model testing the correlation of length with maximum size takes a
single line, 

``` {r }
library(MASS)
corr.model <- summary(rlm(data=dat,  length ~ age))
````

which shows a significant correlation between maximum age and standard length (P = `r format.pval(2*pt(abs(coef(corr.model)[,'t value']["age"]), corr.model$df, lower.tail=F))`). 

## Comparative studies
Many ecological and evolutionary studies rely on comparisons between
taxa to pursue questions that cannot be approached experimentally.  For 
instance, recent studies have attempted to identify whether 
reef-associated clades experience greater species diversification rates
than non-reef-associated groups [*e.g.* @alfaro2009a].  One can 
identify and compare the numbers of reef associated species in different
families using the `rfishbase` functions presented above.  

In this example, consider the simpler question "Are there more reef-associated
species in *Labridae* than in *Gobiidae*?" Recent research has shown that the 
families Scaridae and Odacidae are nested within Labridae [@westneat2005],
although the three groups are listed as separate families in fishbase. We get 
all the species in fishbase from *Labridae* (wrasses), *Scaridae* 
(parrotfishes) and *Odacidae* (weed-whitings):

``` {r labrid }
labrid <- which_fish("(Labridae|Scaridae|Odacidae)", "Family", fish.data)
````

and get all the species of gobies

``` {r gobycount }
goby <- which_fish("Gobiidae", "Family", fish.data)
````

Identify how many labrids are found on reefs

``` {r labridreef }
labrid.reef <- which_fish("reef", "habitat", fish.data[labrid])
labrids.on.reefs <- table(labrid.reef)
````

and how many gobies are found on reefs:

``` {r gobyreef }
gobies.on.reefs <- table(which_fish("reef", "habitat", fish.data[goby]) )
````

Note that summing the list of true/false values returned gives the total
number of matches.  This reveals that there are `r labrids.on.reefs[["TRUE"]]` 
labrid species associated with reefs, and `r gobies.on.reefs[["TRUE"]]` goby species
associated with reefs.  This example illustrates the power of accessing the
FishBase data: Gobies are routinely listed as the biggest group of reef 
fishes [*e.g.* @bellwood2002] but this is because there are
more species in *Gobiidae* than any other family of reef fish. When one counts 
the species in each group that live on reefs one finds that labrids are actually
the most species-rich family on reefs.

# Integration of analyses

One of the greatest advantages of accessing FishBase directly through
R is the ability to take advantage of other specialized analyses
available through R packages. Users familiar with these
packages can more easily take advantage of the data available on
FishBase. This is  illustrated with an example that combines phylogenetic
methods available in R with quantitative trait data available from
`rfishbase`.

This series of commands illustrates testing for a phylogenetically
corrected correlation between the observed length of a species and
the maximum observed depth at which it is found.  One begins by reading in the
data for a phylogenetic tree of labrid fish (provided in the package), 
and the phylogenetics packages `ape` [@ape] and `geiger` [@geiger].

``` {r results="hide", message=FALSE, cache = FALSE }
data(labridtree)
library(ape)
library(geiger) 
````

Find the species represented on this tree in FishBase 

``` {r  }
myfish <- findSpecies(labridtree$tip.label, fish.data)
````

Get the maximum depth of each species and sizes of each species: 

``` {r depthslabrid }
depths <- getDepth(fish.data[myfish])[,"deep"]
size <- getSize(fish.data[myfish], "length")
````

Drop missing data, and then drop tips from the phylogeny for which data was not available: 

``` {r   }
data <- na.omit(data.frame(size,depths))
pruned <- treedata(labridtree, data)
````


Use phylogenetically independent contrasts [@felsenstein1985] to 
determine if depth correlates with size after correcting for phylogeny:

``` {r }
corr.size <- pic(pruned$data[["size"]],pruned$phy)
corr.depth <- pic(pruned$data[["depths"]],pruned$phy)
corr.summary <- summary(lm(corr.depth ~ corr.size - 1))
````

which returns a non-significant correlation (p = `r corr.summary$coefficients[,4]`). 

``` {r Figure4, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.cap='Correcting for phylogeny, size is not correlated with maximum depth observed in  labrids', dependson="libraries"}
ggplot(data.frame(corr.size,corr.depth), aes(corr.size,corr.depth)) +
 geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=lm, col=1) + 
 xlab("Contrast of standard length (cm)") +
 ylab("Contrast maximum depth (m)") + opts(title="Phylogenetically standardized contrasts")
````

One can also estimate different evolutionary models for these traits 
to decide which best describes the data,

``` {r models, results="hide" }
bm <- fitContinuous(pruned$phy, pruned$data[["depths"]], model="BM")[[1]]
ou <- fitContinuous(pruned$phy, pruned$data[["depths"]], model="OU")[[1]]
````

where the Brownian motion model has an AIC score of `r bm$aic` while
the OU model has a score of `r ou$aic`, suggesting that
`r names(which.min(list(BM=bm$aic,OU=ou$aic)))` is the better model.


# Discussion

With more and more data readily available, informatics is becoming increasingly 
important in ecology and evolution research [@jones2006], bringing new 
opportunities for research [@parr2011a; @michener2012] while also raising new
challenges [@reichman2011]. It is in this spirit that the 
`rfishbase` package provides programmatic access to the data available on the
already widely recognized database, FishBase.  Such tools allow researchers to
take greater advantage of the data available, facilitating deeper and richer 
analyses than would be feasible under only manual access to the data.  The 
examples in this manuscript are intended to illustrate how this package 
works, and to help inspire readers to consider and explore questions that would
otherwise be too time consuming or challenging to pursue.  This paper has 
introduced the functions of the `rfishbase` package and described how they can
be used to improve the extraction, visualization, and integration of FishBase 
data in ecological and evolutionary research.  


## The self-updating study
Because analyses using this data are written in R scripts, it becomes easy to update
the results as more data becomes available on FishBase. Programmatic access to data
coupled with script-able analyses can help ensure that research is more easily reproduced
and also facilitate extending the work in future studies [@peng2011b; @merali2010].
This document is an example of this, using a dynamic documentation interpreter program 
which runs the code displayed to produce the results shown, decreasing the possibility
for faulty code [@knitr].  As FishBase is updated, one can regenerate these results 
with less missing data.  Readers can find the original document which combines the 
source-code and text on the project's [Github page](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase/tree/master/inst/doc/rfishbase).

## Limitations and future directions

FishBase contains much data that has not been made accessible
in machine-readable XML format. The authors are in contact with the database
managers and look forward to providing access to additional types of
data as they become available.  Because most of the data provided in the 
XML comes as plain text rather that being identified with machine-readable
tags, reliability of the results is limited by text matching.  
Improved text matching queries could provide more reliable information, 
and facilitate other specialized queries such as extracting geographic distribution details as categorical
variables or latitude/longitude coordinates.  FishBase taxonomy is inconsistent
with taxonomy provided elsewhere, and additional package functions could help
resolve these differences in assignments.  

`rfishbase` has been available to R users through the [Comprehensive R Archive 
Network](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rfishbase/) since October 2011, 
and has a growing user base.  The project remains in active development
to evolve with the needs of its users.  Users can view the most recent changes 
and file issues with the package on its development website on Github,
([https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase))
and developers can submit changes to the code or adapt it into their own software. 

Programmers of other R software packages can make
use of the `rfishbase` package to make this data available to their
functions, further increasing the use and impact of FishBase. For
instance, the project [OpenFisheries](http://OpenFisheries.org) makes use 
of the `rfishbase` package to provide information about commercially relevant species.
