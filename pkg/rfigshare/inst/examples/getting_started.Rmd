## Obtaining your API keys

Note that there is a nice video introduction to creating applications for the API on the [figshare blog](http://figshare.com/blog/figshare_API_available_to_all/48).  The following tutorial provides a simple walkthrough of how to go about getting your figshare API keys set up so that you can use the `rfigshare` package.  


Create a user account on [FigShare](http://figshare.com) and log in.  From your homepage, select "Applications" from the drop-down menu,

Create a new application:

Enter in the following information:

Then navigate over to the permissions tab.  To get the most out of `rfigshare` you'll want to enable all permissions:

Save the new settings, and then open the application again (View/Edit menu) and click on the "Access Codes" tab.

Record each if the keys into R as follows.  You might want to put this bit of R code into your `.Rprofile` to avoid entering it each time in the future:

```r
options(FigshareKey = "qMDabXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
options(FigsharePrivateKey = "zQXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
options(FigshareToken = "SrpxabQXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
options(FigsharePrivateToken = "yqXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
```

That's it! You are now ready to start using figshare.  Recall you can install the package directly from Github using: 

```r
require(devtools)
install_github("rfigshare", "ropensci")
```

Try authenticating with your credentials:

``` {r }
require(rfigshare)
fs_auth()
````


Try a search for an author, or get the details on a paper:

``` {r }
fs_author_search("Boettiger")
fs_details("138")
````

Try creating your own content:

``` {r }
fs_create("Test title", "description of test", "dataset")
````

This creates an article with the essential metadata information.  In the next tutorial, [Publishing on FigShare from R](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/blob/master/inst/doc/publishing_on_figshare.md) we will describe how to add files, tags, categories, authors, and links to your draft, and then publish it either privately or publicly.
