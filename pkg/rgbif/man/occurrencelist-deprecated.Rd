\details{
  Including many possible values for a particular
  parameter: The following parameters may have many values
  passed to them (e.g., like parameter=c('a','b')):
  scientificname, taxonconceptkey, dataproviderkey,
  dataresourcekey, resourcenetworkkey, basisofrecordcode,
  cellid, centicellid, hostisocountrycode,
  originisocountrycode, originregioncode, year, month, and
  day.

  More on scientificname: Returns only records where the
  scientific name matches that supplied - this is based on
  the scientific name found in the original record from the
  data provider and does not make use of extra knowledge of
  possible synonyms or of child taxa.  For these functions,
  use taxonconceptkey. Including an asterisk '*' in the
  search string causes the service to return records for
  any name starting with the string preceding the asterisk.
  There must be at least three characters preceding the
  asterisk. The scientificname parameter may be repeated
  within a single request - the results will include
  records matching any of the supplied scientific names.

  More on taxonconceptkey: Returns only records which are
  for the taxon identified by the supplied numeric key,
  including any records provided under synonyms of the
  taxon concerned, and any records for child taxa (e.g. all
  genera and species within a family).  Values for
  taxonconceptkey can be found through the taxon web
  service (see http://data.gbif.org/ws/rest/taxon).  Note
  that the service will always search using the
  corresponding concept in the synthetic generated "PORTAL"
  taxonomy (even if the taxonconceptkey is for a concept
  from a specific resource.  Use dataresourcekey to limit
  the search to a single data resource.  The most efficient
  and thorough way to search will be to limit searches to
  taxa belonging to the following ranks: kingdom, phylum,
  class, order, family, genus, species, any infraspecific
  rank. Each record returned from this action (and from the
  get action) also includes a taxonKey attribute which can
  be used in the taxonconceptkey parameter on subsequent
  invocations of the list and count actions. The
  taxonconceptkey parameter may be repeated within a single
  request - the results will include records for any of the
  specified taxa.

  See the GBIF API docs for more details on each parameter:
